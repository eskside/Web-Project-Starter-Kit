# Pages CSS

The `pages/` folder contains page-specific styles. For instance, itâ€™s common to have very specific styles for the home page etc. These files will be minified but not merged to the `style-01.min.css`

I recomend calling these on their own on each specific page although you can merge them into the main style sheet with an edit to the Gulpfile.
