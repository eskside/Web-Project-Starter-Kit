# Components

For small components / modules, there is the `components/` folder. While the `structure/` folder defines the global wireframe, `components/` is more focused on smaller modules like buttons, lists etc. This is where most of your project css files will live as most of your project should be geared towards smaller modules. 

I've kicked things off but now it's time for you to go to work.
