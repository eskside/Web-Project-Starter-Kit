 # Vendors
 
The `vendors/` folder contains any css files from external libraries and frameworks like Normalize.css. I like to keep these in a seperate folder and never edit them directly.
 
If you have to override a section of any vendor, I recommend you have another folder called `vendors-edits/` in which you create files named after the vendors they overwrite. You should avoid editing the vendor files themselves.
