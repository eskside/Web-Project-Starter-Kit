# Structure

The `structure/` folder contains everything that creates our layout and structure. This is where to place any grid, header, navigation etc. If it deals with structure, it goes in here. As always I've kicked things off a little to get things started.

+ `footer.css` - Contains (footer, copyright)
+ `frame.css`  - Contains (wrappers, rows, main)
+ `header.css` - Contains (header, logo)
+ `hero.css`   - Contains (full screen hero section)
+ `nav.css`  	 - Contains (navigation, toggle-button)
