# Images

The `images/` folder is divided into 3 folders. Backgrounds, Content and Icons to help tidy things up. The images folder can easily become a mess if your project contains lots of images so feel free to add more folders to suit your project requirements. 

This project contains [picturefill.js](http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) as a pollyfill for `srcset` and `sizes`. You can add several images for the browser to choose from given the current users situation. The `index.html` file contains a basic example of using `srcset`. Refer to the pictuerfill link above for more detailed examples.
