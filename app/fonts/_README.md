# Fonts

The `fonts/` folder is where we store the project fonts if hosting them. To create fonts in various formats check out [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator). Alternatively you can use [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) or any other online service to serve your fonts and delete this folder from the project.
